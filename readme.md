# jQuery Feedback plugin

jQuery feedback provides an easy way to communicate feedback directly to the user.

The goal of this project is to provide a tool as easy to use as alert() but much more user friendly from a user perspective. You should only use feedback to indicate a short message (a sentence or so).
